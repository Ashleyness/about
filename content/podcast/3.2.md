**Beyang:** All right, welcome back to another iteration of the Sourcegraph Podcast. Today I’m here with Max Howell, creator of Homebrew, the popular package manager for macOS, a prominent contributor to the Mac and Swift open-source communities, and most recently, the founder of Tea, a new decentralized package manager that aims to solve the hairy problem of open-source funding. Max, welcome to the show.

**Max:** Hey, great to be here.

**Beyang:** Awesome. It’s so good to have you. We have so much ground to cover, but the way we always kick things off here on Sourcegraph Podcast is by asking people how they got into programming. So, going back to, you know, your beginnings as a programmer, what was the thing that got you into this world?

**Max:** Yeah. When I was six, my dad brought home this computer that we had in the UK, called the BBC Micro, and it was, in fact, indeed made, in some manner at least, by the BBC, or they sponsored it. Certainly, they stuck ‘BBC’ all over it. And one of the things about it that was interesting, and I think is kind of a shame that this doesn’t still happen is that it booted straight into a prompt that was not, like, Bash, not a shell, it was a programming language. It was BBC BASIC, which was a very typical BASIC and probably didn’t deserve to be branded BBC. I’m sure this was like, you know, someone else’s BASIC, I’m not really sure.

But because it booted straight into the prompt, my dad started playing around with it, and then he introduced me to what you could do. And obviously, the first few programs we wrote were the ones that you do see from time to time when you go to computer museums, the PRINT HELLO, on line 10, and then on line 20, GOTO 10. Because BASICs used to number all their lines, and then you referred to them that way, which was a very easy way to get the hang of what program flow was like. And it is actually kind of a shame that there isn’t any major BASICs around nowadays, I think, for people to learn from. Like, it seems a lot harder to jump straight into JavaScript or Python than it was for me to get into BASIC.

So yeah, from a very young age, I was into it, but just as something that I was doing with everything else that a child does. So, I made video games. And [laugh] remember, I got in and out of it, and I remember when I was 11, 12-ish, at school, I’d go to the library at lunch and just work on this game that I was making. And me and some friends were, like, competing to figure out how to make any kind of game scroll. We started off making this, like, Asteroids kind of game, it was like a maze. You had a ship and you moved through this maze.

And we couldn’t figure out how to make the screen scroll so we have this, like, little competition among us. I was the first to figure out how to make a game, like how to make it so that keypresses moved something on the screen. And this was before the internet, of course, or the internet was extremely nascent then. Like, we did not have it. So, we had to scour the manuals and figure it out.

And then my friend, I came in one lunch, and he was like, “I figured out how to make it scroll.” He was just so thrilled at himself. Yeah, it opened up a whole new sort of era in our BASIC video game-making. So yeah, for a long time, like, that was it for me. I never considered it as a career because nobody in my life programmed for a job.

**Beyang:** What did your parents do?

**Max:** My mom was an interior designer and my dad was just like someone who did, like, construction, essentially, like, internal inside houses work. But my dad was very into math and electronics and, you know, programming to a certain extent. Like, he used to play chess with me until I got better than him and then he just suddenly stopped playing with me. [laugh].

**Beyang:** [laugh].

**Max:** So yeah, my mom always, like, gave me this impression that the only things worth doing were, like, being a lawyer or a doctor. It wasn’t, you know, something she did deliberately, but it never was something I considered. And I remember, I went through a career fair when I was 16, 17, and I went to the programmers who were there and talked to them. And I came away feeling that they were just so geeky that I didn’t want to do it. [laugh].

**Beyang:** [laugh]. You were turned off by the nerdiness.

**Max:** Yeah. Yeah.
