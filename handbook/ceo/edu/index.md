# Product education

NOTE: This entire document should be considered a brain dump. It often breaks the 4th wall and cycles often without delination among (1) describing the situation dryly and factually, (2) analyzing the situation critically, and (3) suggesting or speaking in the messaging we might use with an external audience. The section structure of this doc is mostly arbitrary. It is far from being ready as an immediately useful sales enablement doc!


## Who we target

There are a few ways we categorize organizations and people.

### Organization categories


### People categories

## Big Code (the problem)

<!-- TODO(sqs): insert [Big Code cycle](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_4LXbYu4gBwE32GDFtEGpytYGw7xrV-jq6hQmIyXE40/edit#slide=id.gbea2b2251e_0_94) -->

Big Code is the vicious cycle: **more devs** leads to **more code**, which creates **more complexity**, which requires **more devs**, and so on. This makes it so much harder to innovate and ship great products to your customers. Every successful and growing organization faces this Big Code problem.

Proof points of Big Code being a valid and important problem:

- Sequoia led Sourcegraph's $50M Series C fundraising round in December 2020 because they see Big Code as the defining challenge for the top 2000 companies in the world.
- Our customer logos show that the leading companies across many industries and continents see Big Code as a problem. TODO: Convey that the Big Code problem is actually even worse in the kind of company that isn't an early adopter of Sourcegraph.
- More press coverage of Big Code: TODO
- Big Code survey: TODO
- TODO: software engineer YoY career growth ~8% and nobody expects that is going to dip
- TODO: something like: The entire field of software development has only been around for a few decades. Most of the world's code was written in the last 5 years (NOTE: made-up placeholder number). If you think you're already dealing with a lot of code and a lot of legacy code, you won't know what hits you in the next 10 years.

## Business value proposition

- What specific problems and pains (within Big Code) do we address?
- What is the business value of addressing these pains?

### Boost dev productivity

With Big Code, everything your devs do takes longer and longer. They lose flow more often and get frustrated. No matter how fast your builds are, how good your deployment system is, etc., if there's a lot of code and complexity, developers will struggle to understand the code and their productivity will suffer.

Pains:

- Poor developer onboarding (for new employees and when existing employees switch projects)
- Loss of flow
- Knowledge silos
- Unclear ownership of code
- Code duplication
- Poor code quality
- Dev frustration
- Manual processes

Benefits:

- Get more from your existing dev team
- Attract, retain, and leverage top talent

Resources:

- TODO can use the [75% of a developer's time is spent understanding code](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_4LXbYu4gBwE32GDFtEGpytYGw7xrV-jq6hQmIyXE40/edit#slide=id.gbfe7309889_0_102) as a proof point

### Ease innovation

Low dev productivity may seem like "just" a developer issue, but it leads to the company-wide problem of it being harder to innovate, to ship new things, deprecate old things, or make any big improvements. You get to the end of the year and you wonder, "What did we do? How did we make so little progress on the roadmap?" That's scary to everyone at the company because you're counting on these new products and features to increase revenue.

Pains:

- Slow new product development
- Tech debt
- Process-heavy
- Backcompat consumes inordinate amount of time
- Afraid to break things
- Risky releases
- Legacy code pileup

Benefits:

- Increase revenue by shipping better products sooner

### Reduce security risk

Your security risks grow as your code expands and ages. It's not just forward progress that's slowing, but also your devs experience huge setbacks whenever there are incidents, and your company faces existential threats if you leak sensitive data. You're already mitigating this, but that inevitably means lower productivity and slower innovation as devs are interrupted for incident response and more manual security/compliance processes.

Pains:

- Weeks (not hours) to fix critical bugs
- Unmaintained, decaying code
- Ad-hoc incident response
- Devs interrupted frequently

Benefits:

- Reduce disruptions to dev teams (to boost dev productivity and ease innovation)
- Reduce existential threat to business

## Product components

We use the 

```
Search > Understand > Act/Automate
```

This is not a "pyramid". Any of these components can be the entry point (the first thing that a customer wants to do). Different personas will likely find different components most interesting.

Universal applies to all of these.

This also helps explain our differentiation. GitHub and OpenGrok do *some* of Search. GitHub does some parts of Understand and Act/Automate.

## What's different about selling Sourcegraph

Selling Sourcegraph is different from selling other kinds of enterprise software in several important ways.

### Code search has no compelling event / TODO "Creating a compelling event"

An organization--and our buyer--generally doesn't feel acute, quantifiable pain if they roll out code search next month instead of today. There are almost never any important projects or deadlines for which an organization needs code search by a specific date. Even if the buyer sees evidence of code search boosting dev productivity and happiness, it's tough to quantify the cost of waiting a few more days or weeks.

Code search is not seen as adding a brand new capability, only enhancing existing workflows.

We are mitigating this by.

### Search is not a system of record / TODO "Spreading adoption to all code-adjacent users in a company"

### Users take a while to become accustomed to using search / TODO "Winning over devs who haven't used code search before"

It's one thing to win over a dev who's a regular user of OpenGrok (or some other existing code search tool). It's another thing to win over devs who haven't used any kind of code search tool.
