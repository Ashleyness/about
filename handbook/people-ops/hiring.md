# Hiring

## Values and practices

1. We want our hiring process to access all potential qualified candidates.
   - We proactively promote our open positions to many different groups, communities, and networks.
   - If we believe there is a talented set of individuals who are not applying to our team, we will initiate outbound efforts to reach them. We believe there is value in reaching out to candidates who are not directly connected to the social graph of our team today.
1. We want our hiring process to be fair to all candidates.
   - Our job descriptions use inclusive language.
   - We ask a consistent set of questions to each candidate so that we can objectively measure performance across candidates.
   - There are two interviewers in each interview so that we can better detect and compensate for misunderstandings during the interview and biases in the written feedback after the interview.
   - Interviewers take written notes during the interview so there is an objective record of the interview that can be referenced when making a hiring decision.
   - All interviewers submit written feedback independently before being able to see feedback from other interviewers. Feedback may not be edited after submission.
   - We maintain a consistent hiring [decision process](#decision-making-process) for all candidates.
1. Hiring managers own the hiring process for their team.
    - Hiring managers are encouraged to experiment to learn how to improve their hiring process.
    - The handbook is kept up-to-date with our learnings and current norms.

## Open positions

We welcome suggestions for more places that we can post!

## Job descriptions

Each job description lists qualifications (requirements) and nice-to-haves. If you are unsure if you meet our qualifications, please apply.

We prefer to avoid listing "years of experience" as a qualification because time is only an indirect measure of what we really care about: skills and maturity.

Our team contains highly motivated and productive members who've joined immediately after high school/university or after 10+ years of working at some of the best companies.

## Decision making process

We review each candidate at each stage of our hiring pipeline (e.g. application, phone screen, interviews, references) to determine if we want to move the candidate to the next stage. Here are some things that we consider:

- Applications
    - Does this candidate meet all qualifications for the role they are applying for?
    - Does this candidate's resume and application effectively communicate their skills, accomplishments, and a genuine interest in Sourcegraph?
    - How do this candidate's skills, accomplishments, and interest in Sourcegraph compare to other candidates or our current team?
    - What makes this candidate's application stand out and excite us about moving forward with interviews?
- Interviews
    - Does this candidate have the skills and experience that we are looking for?
    - How do this candidate's skills, accomplishments, and interest in Sourcegraph compare to other candidates or our current team?
    - What makes us excited about hiring this candidate?

## Making a referral

Current employees can refer a candidate [here](https://hire.lever.co/referrals/new)

## Hiring flow

For any members of a hiring team, please see [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1tJAroT8Z1sPnWkETSbe2mFFaD5_g7Q_E) for a breakdown of each team's hiring process. The documents will outline responsibilities by role (Hiring Manager, Scheduling Coordinator, and People Ops) for each team.

## Stages in our application tracking system

| Stage name  |  Why a candidate is in this stage |
|---|---|
|  New lead |  This is the first stage for a sourced candidate. | 
|  Reached out | When we have contacted a sourced candidate.  | 
|  New applicant | This is the first stage for a candidate that applied to the role directly or referred to the role. | 
|  Application review |  Candidates that the hiring manager should review and decide on next steps.  | 
|  Recruiter screen | Candidates that the recruiter has scheduled to screen. | 
|  Initial screen |  First call with the hiring team. | 
|  Assignment |  Candidates that we have scheduled to complete an assignment, or waiting for a decision after they have completed the assignment.  | 
|  Interview |  Candidates that are in rounds of interviews after the “initial screen” and “assignment” stages.| 
|  Debrief |  Candidates that have completed the “interview stage” and interview panel need to discuss whether we should extend an offer to the candidate. | 
|  Reference check |  Candidates that we have decided to make an offer to. | 
|  Offer |  Candidates that we are preparing an offer, or have extended an offer to. | 
|  Offer accepted |  Candidates that have accepted our offer.| 
|  Hired | Candidate has started at the company.| 

#### When should I move a candidate to the next stage? 

Candidates should be moved to the next stage once you have decided the candidate has passed the round they are currently in. 

Examples:
   - A candidate is in the “new applicant” stage. You have reviewed their profile and want to conduct an initial screen. You should move the candidate to the “initial screen stage” at this time. Do not wait until the initial screen is scheduled to update the candidate’s stage. 

   - A debrief has finished and we decided to extend an offer. Move the candidate from the “debrief” stage to the “offer” stage. Do not wait until the offer is extended to update the candidate’s stage. 

#### Importance of having candidate in correct stage

Candidate stages and when they are moved into those stages are tracked in our application tracking system. This data is used our hiring pipeline (examples: funnel reports and number offers we made in a given period of time).

## Sharing interview feedback

We don't share specific reasons or feedback if we [decide](#decision-making-process) not to move forward in our hiring process with a candidate.

It would be nice if we could give feedback like this, but we don't do this today. Why?

- The written feedback that we collect during our interview process is intended for an internal audience. We don't ask our interviewers to spend time and effort packaging their feedback in a way that can be delivered directly to candidates.
- Adequately summarizing all interview feedback for a candidate is challenging and time consuming. We choose to spend our time focusing on delivering developmental feedback to our existing teammates.

If any interviewer is asked by a candidate for interview feedback, they may respond with the following message:

> I understand the desire to receive feedback from our interview process, but unfortunately we are not in a position to give it. Here is some public documentation to that effect: https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/people-ops/hiring#sharing-interview-feedback.

## Respecting time

Interviewing requires time and effort, both for us and for candidates. The hiring manager is responsible for monitoring feedback during the interview phase, and if it becomes obvious that we won't be moving forward with a candidate, then the hiring manager should cancel any remaining interviews to be respectful of both the candidate's and interviewers' time.

## Sharing company financials

Choosing to join a company is a significant commitment. We want people to have an accurate view of Sourcegraph's financial and business position before they join. (Every Sourcegraph team member after they join has regular access to this information on our Google Drive, and they can ask the CEO directly if they have any other questions.)

> Hiring managers: If you're asked a question like this and you aren't 100% confident about the answer, please pass the question to the CEO or VP Business.

1. What is the company's latest valuation? (We share this when we give you the offer.)
1. What percentage of the company does my option grant represent? (We share this when we give you the offer.)
1. What is the total number of fully diluted shares? (You can calculate this from the number of options in your grant and the percentage that represents, but we're also happy to share this number.)
1. Other details about options. (These are covered in the employment paperwork you will receive.)

Here are some other questions that candidates have asked (e.g., in the [CEO interview](../ceo/index.md#interviews-with-me)):

1. What is the current runway and the monthly burn rate?
1. How much cash does the company have in the bank?
1. Other [questions about Sourcegraph's internal financial metrics](../ceo/index.md#questions-about-sourcegraph).

## Making an offer

Once the decision is made to [extend an offer](interview_process.md#outcome) to a candidate, the hiring manager and a representative from the People Ops team will schedule a call to walk through a summary of the offer. This summary will include an overview of cash compensation (including any commission or bonus plans), benefits, and any equity-based compensation (including a simple calculator for potential future values).

With the candidate's approval, Sourcegraph will then conduct three reference check interviews with former peers and at least one former manager. If we are happy with the results, the Sourcegraph legal team will send the official DocuSign with the appropriate contracting or employment agreement(s) for the candidate's role, status, and location. Templates for employees and contractors can be found in the shared [HR/Employees/Contractors Dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/home/Legal/HR%3AEmployees%3AContractors).
