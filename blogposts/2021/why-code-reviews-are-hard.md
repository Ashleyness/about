Software developers often begin with the same expectation: I am here to write code. Good code. Useful code. After a while, developers realize they read more code than they write.

Most developers’ core daily duties include reviewing the latest code changes. These code reviews serve many purposes and are generally a good thing. Yet, most developers despise them. This is because code reviews are way more painful than they should be.

Why is this the case? Code reviews are nothing new. We should be able to make them uncomplicated and efficient.

In this article, we explore why code reviews are important, who should conduct them, and what we can do to make them more efficient.

## Why code reviews are painful
Software projects are complex, but the right processes, tooling, frameworks, and devices can help tame this complexity. One way to improve code quality, minimizing bugs and security flaws, is conducting code reviews. In this process, reviewers — either predetermined or ad-hoc — look over a set of changes. This is usually a merge request.

There are flaws in this setup. The first flaw is the selection of who should review the change. People might assume that only the most senior engineers should review code because they have the most experience, and their input can teach the code’s creator. But, busy senior developers don’t have time to handle every code review, and junior developers don’t want to wait days or weeks for a completed review.

The second flaw is that many reviewers focus only on technical aspects, as these are easy to check. Does the code use the latest language features correctly? Does it follow the style guide? Does it follow best practices? Reviewers often focus on these questions, skipping questions about whether the code does what it should and how it covers edge cases.

Part of the issue is that the tooling for delivering code reviews needs more context. The context requires the full source code, not only the changes. Of course, the tool needs to highlight respective changes, but that doesn’t mean a review should consist of only the changed code.

Many tools show what has changed. The pull request approvals at GitHub or Azure DevOps, Bitbucket, Gerrit, and Phabricator, excel at diffing. But, they fail to provide context with ease. Quite often, code reviewers need to open an integrated development environment (IDE) next to the approval tool to get the context they need.

The third pitfall with code reviews is their size. Code changes should be so minimal that reviewing takes almost no time. The context should be straightforward, and everything should seem logical. This isn’t always the case, though. Change requests are often bloated. They consist of many commits, including cleanups, changes to unrelated areas, and refactoring in related technical areas without any business impact.

Large change requests result in exceedingly long reviews, usually taking hours or days to complete. This blocks the change from occurring and drains resources. Reviewers may also forget to check basic items, overlooking issues or missing opportunities for improvements.  

The review may be lengthy and incomplete. There may be too many review issues to tackle reliably, which is another reason to avoid large change requests. Also, large changes are inevitable, so there must be a way to cope with those, too.

What can we do to mitigate these issues and improve the code review process?

## Improving the code review process
Improving the review process starts with establishing and implementing a structured approach. To avoid context switching (or side-task distraction), you should conduct code reviews at fixed times — unless, of course, there is a bug fix that developers need to apply as soon as possible. Perform code reviews in a pair or mob programming manner, involving both junior and senior developers.

Including less-experienced developers in the review process is beneficial. Reviewing code created by more experienced developers will help them to get to the same level faster.

Also, less-experienced developers tend to ask more basic questions. Senior developers may not ask these questions, but talking them through may produce interesting answers. Sometimes, a small question triggers a non-trivial chain of thought that leads to new insights.

Senior developers are often resistant to certain changes. For example, there might be hesitation towards changing the code style from object-oriented programming (OOP) to more functional programming (FP). Junior developers tend to be more open to change and are less likely to preserve systems purely because they’re familiar.

One advantage of reviewing code together is that discussions happen more naturally and directly. Still, reviewers need to present feedback in comments, so remarks are not only addressed but also documented.

Another advantage is that junior developers can ask questions and get answers from experienced developers without much friction. This way, the formal code review process also acts as a case study in learning how to code.

With a larger group performing the review, the technical focus should also shift. Usually, groups are more into the “why” than the “how.” This leads to investigating if the desired behavior is correctly implemented, and if edge cases are handled. Sometimes, it also identifies potential missing cases and scenarios to consider in future implementation. The review then produces a direct positive business impact.

To reduce larger code reviews, timebox each review session. Always determine its focus in the beginning, and check each file. So, the change creator sees completed reviews and what is still left after each review session.

But, what about context? How can we improve context retrieval? An enhanced code search is helpful here.

## Introducing universal code search
Universal code searches help improve many aspects of software development. This new tool eases code review pain by providing reviewers the right context, whether implicitly or on demand. Finding all references or jumping to definitions is only the beginning. There’s also no need to spin up a local integrated development environment.

Universal code search combines different repositories using different project types and languages in one search engine. The result is a knowledge graph of all combined sources that developers can query from a single location. This is done using a set of smart filters and context-aware operators. The search engine understands relationships between different parts of the code and treats them correctly.

A solution like Sourcegraph allows developers to enhance existing tools such as GitHub or GitLab with universal search integration. Integrations are a vital part of the expected developer experience. Without the necessary integrations, developers may need to switch tooling.

With universal code search running on GitHub, more context is available directly in the code review. Method or function names link to corresponding sections of the codebase. There’s no need to keep a separate copy of the code open in your editor or integrated development environment to follow along and explore the changes.

Search features in integrated development environments and text editors aren’t always up to the task of finding what’s needed. For example, code might be present many times, in different locations, in a database. Universal code search’s ability to spot similar code or duplicates is useful for developers. It identifies existing code much better and infers potential refactoring paths.

These universal code search abilities also reduce the impact of large code reviews. Reviewers can see and understand larger change sets.

## Streamline your next code review
Code reviews are an essential part of a software engineer’s daily work. With the correct tools, processes, and mindsets, software engineers can review change requests reliably and swiftly. This efficiency enables overall velocity, making everyone — not only developers — happy.

Conduct reviews at fixed times, ensuring clear goals. Involve both senior and junior developers to inspire a broad range of questions and considerations. Combining senior developers’ experience with junior developers’ open-mindedness not only results in a stronger code review but also creates a learning opportunity. When reviewing code, examine it with desired behavior in mind. Even elegant, error-free code can fall short if it doesn’t achieve the right goal.

Universal search helps to answer questions and find context to understand the problem. The right tool can streamline your workflow, eliminating the need to work off copied files or switch platforms.

Together, these solutions and strategies can make your next code review less painful.
