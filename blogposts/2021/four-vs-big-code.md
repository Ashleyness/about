In 2020, we issued a survey of more than 500 software development professionals in North America on the challenges and risks posed by increasing code complexity. 
The key findings of the survey is that code is profoundly growing in four ways (four Vs!): volume, variety, velocity, and value. 
This is what we call the rise of Big Code, and here’s how it affects developers:

## Big survey short: Code is profoundly growing in: 

Volume: exponential increases in the amount of code 
Variety: significant complexity in the languages, tools, and processes used for delivering software
Velocity: accelerated delivery cycles that mean code is changing faster and being shipped virtually every day
Value: the reimagination of business models and practices through high-quality software

The impact of accelerated growth across these markers touches almost everyone. 94% reported that they’re affected by Big Code. 
Below, we’ll break down how each of these four Vs affect those who are increasingly having to manage and mitigate Big Code’s multi-faceted complexities as they strive to innovate and grow. 
This isn’t just a tech problem: hospitals and banks, urban development and retail, hospitality and travel are affected too. 

## Code is growing in Volume

51% of our respondents reported having more than 100 times the volume of code they had 10 years ago. 
And a staggering 18% say they have _500_ times more code.

100–500 times is a colossal increase, and the solution isn’t simply adding a larger headcount, or hiring especially efficient teammates. 

For example, if you’re incorporating new code into existing code, you’ll want an effective way to search, test, and replace/combine. 
Accessible tools, open communication and documentation, and clear intent during this phase will help future developers mitigate the burden of combing through endless lines of code without a flashlight. 
But 85% responded that the existing tools weren’t designed for this volume of code, while 99% agreed that their teams would benefit from additional capabilities for searching enterprise code. 

## Code is growing in Variety

More than 60% of respondents reported a significant or dramatic increase in different programming languages, code hosts, repositories, version control systems, architecture, supported devices, use of open source, number of platforms, APIs, and more. 
Specifically, more than 6 out of 10 software professionals reported a significant increase across a wide range of these different development dimensions in the past decade. 

Without strategy, architecture, and communication, we limit our ability to speak the same language across an ecosystem of different technologies and our ability to pivot, translate, and execute confidently and in a timely manner. 
57% reported difficulties managing changes, which makes sense given the sheer rise of variety developers need to grapple with. 
When you couple rising variety _and_ volume the result is increased frustration for developers finding specific code, the time it takes to understand new codebases, and slow code reviews, which hamper productivity. 

How do you keep up? Fortunately, in addition to the huge growth in variety of languages and systems, there has also been huge growth in the amount of education material available. 
Learning new frameworks, libraries and tools is now a requirement of a software developer’s job, but there are also many high-quality books and guides available. 
Does your developer team have an education budget, so that you can expense learning materials? You should, because continuous learning is a necessary part of the software developer profession.

## Code is growing in Velocity

92% of participants reported that the pressure they feel to release code faster has increased in the past 10 years. 
Development approaches and practices like Agile, scrum, and DevOps enable organizations to complete faster builds and swiftly deploy new releases, but the flipside for developers is mounting pressure to release code faster and faster. 
That pressure leads to anxiety and fear, which not only affects our mental health, but the quality of our work. 

If the expectation is meeting hyper-fast deadlines, then our launches become stress tests, disrupting teams and diminishing innovation, leading to shortcuts in documentation and a decrease in productive collaboration. 
“Move fast and break things” in this case is a recipe of burnout and low morale.

How can developer teams deal with this? [Marek Zaluski](/handbook/company/team#marek-zaluski), a developer education engineer here at Sourcegraph says automation can help. 
"Instead of manually testing and deploying, make sure you’re making the most of automated testing and continuous deployment. 
Take a close look at your team’s development process and ask questions like: 'Where are our biggest bottlenecks? 
What steps in the process are causing the most stress and pressure for our team?'"

## Code is growing in Value

For our survey respondents, the overwhelming majority (90%!) reported that the software their teams deliver has become more critical in the past decade. 
It doesn’t matter if the software is the product itself or the engine—either way it’s among many companies’ most valued assets, propelling critical internal operations or generating direct revenue. 

This growing importance of software, and how it can directly shape a business, was a bright nugget in our survey of the effects of Big Code. 
90% of stakeholders reported that their business models and practices have undergone meaningful change because of the software their teams built. 
And the data also show that companies outside of technology are now behaving more like tech companies. 
91% of software development stakeholders reported that their business is acting more like a tech company than it did a decade ago. 
If more and more companies are experiencing this shift and placing greater value on software, the explosion of volume, variety, and velocity in Big Code will follow.
