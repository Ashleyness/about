# Diversity, equity, and inclusion

> At Sourcegraph, we want to make it so [everyone can code](../company/strategy.md), so that technology's benefits reach the whole world. To do that, and to even understand what's necessary to do that, our team needs to represent a diverse set of perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds. We also believe that talent is equally distributed, so we strive for our team to demonstrate that by being inclusive of and equitable toward all people. This page describes our efforts and commitments to work toward these outcomes, and we expect to improve and expand our plans here as we learn and grow.

Sourcegraph’s first steps towards creating a diverse team came with the decision to work remotely, and engage the right talent regardless of the country, city and timezone they were located in. As well as increasing access to talent across the globe, this decision also makes our working environment more inclusive of talent who are otherwise unable or unwilling to spend each day in an office, such as talent who take care of dependents at home, may not have access to transport, or have physical restrictions that making commuting difficult. 

After deciding to work remotely, we further bolstered equity by:

 - Choosing to offer compensation that was independent of location
 - Making sure our talent was supported in working remotely - including offering home desk set-up,coworking space, and internet benefits.
 - Working asynchronously as much as reasonable, to ensure our teammates across time zones and working schedules are included in conversations and calls for input 

Our initiatives since then have been focused on identifying and acting on the potential obstacles to diversity and inclusivity in our existing teams and hiring process - the most impactful steps we could take to reduce bias and discrimination from our processes and interactions.  Up to and including FY22Q2, we:
 - Implemented standardised, benchmarked compensation criteria related to each role
 - Bolstered our Talent team with a VP Talent and a team of skilled recruiters, who have implemented screening for our “Be welcoming and inclusive” value throughout the hiring process, with questions asked by recruiters, hiring managers, and teammates: such as asking what candidates have done to ensure their co-workers feel a sense of belonging, how they’ve advocated for someone else,how they’ve contributed to building cultures of inclusivity in their previous workplaces.
 - Implemented Unconscious Bias training for all teammates and structured interviews to reduce bias as much as possible from our hiring process
 - Refined our guidelines around paid time off to be inclusive of multiple reasons for PTO: including wellbeing PTO, religious PTO, and life PTO. 
 - Asked all teammates to participate in an anonymous survey around what could be improved in our culture and ways of working, allowing all teammates to provide feedback on what could enhance our value of being welcoming and inclusive 
 - Started destigmatizing the topic of mental health in the workforce by identifying an independent wellbeing provider that could provide support for our teammates via counselling, coaching and external support groups. 
 - Started collecting employee demographic data through our hiring process, so we can identify where we can improve our recruiting or hiring process to attract and retain diverse talent.

For the remainder of FY22, we aim to roll out the following initiatives: 
 - Job levelling across teams, aimed at ensuring our managers use skill-based criteria to assess each contributor’s level of impact, thereby reducing the risk of bias in these decisions
 - Launching Modern Health, our independent wellbeing provider, offering 10 counselling and coaching sessions per year for each of our employees, as well as access to a range of diverse support groups (COVID-19, LQBTQ+, Black Lives Matter, Asian communities, Latinx communities)
 - Building relationships with code schools and organizations focused on helping folks in underserved communities break into tech, and increase diversity in our candidate pipelines (as a first step toward later developing an apprenticeship program)
 - Launch manager training for all managers, which includes modules around avoiding discrimination and building inclusive teams. We are further exploring engaging external experts on workplace diversity and inclusion to compliment this internal training and help us identify specific areas of attention.
 - Create a handbook page providing additional guidance on referrals, noting that hiring managers assess referrals the same as any other candidate and offering guidance on how referrals can support our goals to have a more diverse candidate pool
 - Again ask all teammates to participate in an anonymous survey around what could be improved in our culture and ways of working, allowing all teammates to provide feedback on what could enhance our value of being welcoming and inclusive
 - Develop an apprenticeship program to help us build a diverse team where there is a shortage of skills (this will build on the relationships we are building with code schools and organizations focused on helping folks in underserved communities break into tech)
 - Provide detailed guidance to our teammates on how they can create their own internal support groups, how to purpose those support groups, and how to surface and escalate insights and ideas that will positively impact Sourcegraph as a whole.


We appreciate that this work will never be fully done, and will update this page as we identify, launch and complete future initiatives that will help us make Sourcegraph a place where all teammates feel they belong and can grow their careers. 

We encourage all teammates to give us ideas and feedback at any time via their managers and/or the PeopleOps team. If appropriate, questions can be submitted anonymously via our company meeting form (which is automatically posted to `#general` on Slack each week). 

If you are a candidate and have questions, you can email [hiring@sourcegraph.com](mailto:hiring@sourcegraph.com).
