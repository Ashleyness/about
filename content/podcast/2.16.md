<!-- START SUMMARY -->

Why should devs try to put themselves out of a job? In this episode, James Waldrop, Vice President of Engineering at Fitbit, now part of Google, joins Beyang Liu, co-founder and CTO of Sourcegraph, to share how he once solved a budget problem by firing himself, explain why, as a young engineer, he mistakenly tried to solve a mathematically impossible problem, and tell the story of Twitter being painfully ahead of the curve on microservices. Along the way, James explains how he helped early Twitter deal with massive traffic spikes and how he found a role at Fitbit as a high-profile, high-performance troubleshooter.

<!-- START TRANSCRIPT -->

**Beyang Liu:**

All right, so I'm here with James Waldrop today. James, thanks so much for joining. James is the vice president of engineering at Fitbit, now part of Google. His career encompasses many of the great engineering organizations in Silicon Valley, starting out in the 90s where he worked at many different startups in various roles ranging from software development, engineering management, project management, sales support, investor relations, and demo presenter to Bill Gates. More on that in a bit.

From there, he moved into performance engineering at Salesforce, made his way, eventually, to Twitter where he was one of the original members of the developer productivity team? Is that right?

**James Waldrop:**

I was the first ... Was I the first IC? I want to say I was the first IC.

**Beyang Liu:**

Okay, first IC.

**James Waldrop:**

Then my manager left, I think within three months and I was like, "No, I care about this too much, so we have to keep this going," and I started managing the team.

**Beyang Liu:**

Awesome. So, he was one of the early members of developer productivity at Twitter where he made a big impact, and then he later joined Fitbit, where he also wore both individual contributor and manager hats and eventually became Vice President of Engineering through its acquisition earlier this year by Google. So, James, thank you so much for joining today.

**James Waldrop:**

Yeah, happy to be here. Definitely interested in the topic. As you can tell, it's something I'm passionate about.

**Beyang Liu:**

Awesome. All right, so we have a lot to get into. But before we get into all that, I like to start things off just by asking people how they got into this whole computer business. I think you, in particular, have a unique background. It's my understanding that you didn't even major or study anything technical while you're in college.

**James Waldrop:**

Yeah. Not so unique in my age group.

A lot of us didn’t come in through a traditional route, I would say. Obviously, plenty did come that way. But the internet was just getting going. I'm going to date myself here, but my first internet account, my first access to the internet, was 1989.

I was a freshman at the school I was going to, which has a name brand that I'm not going to say because it's mildly embarrassing. But I was there as a theater and film student–film design, theater design. And my hobby, I had a freshman roommate who was a computer science/engineering–not computer engineering. I forget what the discipline was called back then, and he had an extra account. He knew that computers were something I was sort of interested in but not majoring in, clearly, and he asked me if I was interested in checking out what was accessible with that account.

Hopefully the statute of limitations has expired. I'm sure he was not supposed to do that, but I was happy to take advantage of the offer. I did and I found the internet. I found Usenet, specifically, which is not a thing most people hear about these days. And I found IRC which, amazingly, is still with us. It is still a thing.

Most importantly, the kind of aha moment for me, the light bulb going off, was I was taking a Hebrew class and I found Israelis on IRC that I could try my Hebrew out on and they could tell me how bad it was. That was such a mind blowing moment for me. It was like, I can sit here and talk to people in Israel in real time and actually try to talk Hebrew with them. This is amazing. So, that became every spare moment I had when I wasn't doing sets or lights or technical direction on a play or a film. It was spent on the internet. That's how I eventually came into this role–theater and film. Unfortunately, it wasn't as good at paying the rent as doing the internet things.

**Beyang Liu:**

That's so interesting. So, before that exposure, were you at all into computers growing up or was that your first foray?

**James Waldrop:**

It was not my first. I got a computer. I'm going to sound like your typical white guy here–American white guy, anyway. I got my first computer when I was 12. But unlike most of the people listening, it was promptly stolen because we didn't live in a great neighborhood. Somebody broke into our home and stole the TV. It was a pretty routine occurrence. People were breaking into our home all the time.

**Beyang Liu:**

Oh, my goodness. What?

**James Waldrop:**

Yeah. We don't have to talk about that part of my childhood, but I think I had it for all of a year and I learned how to program Basic, as one does when one has an Atari of that vintage. So now, I was interested but I didn't really have day-to-day access to a computer until I got to school.

**Beyang Liu:**

Interesting. Okay, so you started playing around with computers in college, and then after you graduated, did you try to do the theater thing for a while or did you-

**James Waldrop:**

Can we put air quotes on graduated? I didn't actually graduate.

**Beyang Liu:**

Okay, got it.

**James Waldrop:**

Whatever you want to call that.

**Beyang Liu:**

So, what happened then?

**James Waldrop:**

I worked on a couple films immediately post-not-going-to-school. I'm not going to say post-graduation. But, like I said, they were not good at paying the rent. This was independent film, and in independent film, you don't earn very much money at all. If you're in a production role–I was doing production design–if you're in that kind of role on an independent film, you're breaking into the industry. So, I needed a day job, and my day job was being a temp–like most of my peers, to be honest. Just a temp hiring my services out.

Now, because I was computer literate, after a few years of doing that kind of thing, I was a valuable commodity because I could type well and I could understand VMS, actually. I could figure out VMS because I had already figured out UNIX Systems. And so, the idea of coming into a word processing system that nobody had ever used before? They couldn't really find anybody else so they were like, "We love you."

Now, being loved as a temp is not exactly a life's goal or anything, but it turned out, strangely, to lead to a job in the industry because I was working for a pharmaceutical company. They were then called Smithkline Beecham. I think they're GlaxoSmithKline or something like that, anyway, now. I've not tracked them. But, yeah, I was working for them and I was basically just doing word processing as a temp while I worked on films in the evenings and weekends and all that kind of stuff.

When I had spare time, which was surprisingly often, the VMS system had access to the internet so I would hop on the systems that I had access to, shells that I had elsewhere, and do stuff–code. Because by that point I was actually writing code. People would walk by and ask me what the heck I was doing because they didn't really know what to make of what they saw on my screen. I would explain and they would get fascinated.

One of those people knew someone who worked for a medical communications company in Philadelphia, where I was. He was very foresightful. He thought that medical communications would be happening over the internet–this was 1992–and that the internet was where that needed to go. He wanted to hire somebody who could help figure out how to make that work. This woman, who knew what I was interested in as a hobby, introduced us. And this guy, Michael Scott, hired me.

**Beyang Liu:**

Michael Scott hired you.

**James Waldrop:**

That was his name. That's his actual name. This was a long time ago.

**Beyang Liu:**

That's awesome.

**James Waldrop:**

Yeah, and super nice guy. Well, he could be a real handful. One of those crusty exterior, soft interior kind of guys. Yeah, I ended up helping get that company online, building them a website. I used Linux to do it. That was the cheaper way to do it. I learned a ton and helped that company do things that were probably fairly pioneering for the time and also got a job that paid the rent in a bit of a better way.

**Beyang Liu:**

So, was that like telemedicine then?

**James Waldrop:**

No, the bandwidth was nowhere near sufficient for telemedicine at that point. No, it was–this is kind of a digression. Maybe you'll find a way to cut out some of this.

**Beyang Liu:**

No worries.

**James Waldrop:**

If you're a medical professional, if you're a nurse or you're a doctor or you're in some role like that, then you are required by your certifying bodies to do some amount of medical education every year. And so, they did continuing medical education. At the time, the way that that was delivered was through symposia. So, you'd fly everybody out. But the FDA was starting to regulate that stuff so it couldn't just be a junket. You couldn't just fly everybody to Hawaii, let them golf for five days and then get their CME credits. You needed to actually educate them. And so, people were a little less excited about having to fly somewhere if they had to listen to a seminar on benign prostatic hyperplasia, as an example of one of those things that they would do. They work with, who were they called? Schering-Plough, I think.

Anyway, he thought that that medical education, which was mostly just reading and understanding things and then saying, "Yes, I have passed a comprehension test," could be delivered online. Clearly, he was absolutely right. We do all kinds of CME now over the internet. But that was the original idea.

**Beyang Liu:**

That's interesting. What is the general arc from getting into the industry through that medical communications company to eventually demoing something to Bill Gates? What were the steps to that?

**James Waldrop:**

I know people feel like life moves really fast these days. But in the mid-90s, life was moving at some crazy pace that I have never seen since, and I hope never to see again because it was insane.

I started working for this medical communications company. How long was I there? I think I was there for two years. This is sort of a weird story, but it was much harder to get internet access back then. I could pay, I think the number was $8000 a month, for a T1 to the local POP, which was over the river from Philly where I was. That would get us internet access at 1.5 megabits a second, right?

**Beyang Liu:**

Yes.

**James Waldrop:**

Or I could pay $800 a month, literally 10 times less, if I would put our packets on the WilTel frame relay network, which ran at 56k. Quite a bit slower, but we didn't really need high speeds. And we would backhaul over the WilTell frame relay network to San Francisco, and then it would be put on the internet there. That was $800 a month versus $8,000 a month. I said to myself, "Self, if I really want to do this as a profession, I need to be in the Bay area where it's 10x cheaper to get online."

Because I knew Linux–again, buying a Sun workstation was well outside of the range of what we could afford–I built a system, put Slackware on it and ran email, ran the SMTP server, and ran a web server. This was http back then, kind of Apache server, and just homebrewed it all as much as I could.

Well, that company, the ISP that we had, when they found out that I was setting up a Linux system, that was new and special back then and so they wanted my expertise to come help them with Linux. They offered me a job, and I said, "Cool. Great, I've been wanting to move to the Bay area."

And so, I moved out here in October '94. Within, I want to say, four months–within a very crazy short amount of time–I was working for a different ISP. I'm not going to go into why I left the first one. Suffice to say that it wouldn't reflect well on some people.

I went to another ISP. Within a couple months of that, maybe four months of that, I went to work for a company called Ubique because of a community I was part of called The Well. One of the members there introduced me and said he was going off to run SFGATE, which is still a going concern. You can go check out the SFGATE website right now. It was back when SFGATE was first being created and Tex was off to run SFGATE and he recruited me to replace him at this company Ubique. That was an Israeli-based company. Within six months or fewer, obviously the timeline is like bang, bang, bang here, that company had been bought by AOL. And so, it was like three jobs in less than a year.

I remember vividly having a call where I decided, after that call was over, that I needed to find a new job from that first ISP. Calling up a friend of mine, saying, "Hey, I think I might be needing a new job." I had a job the next day.

**Beyang Liu:**

Wow.

**James Waldrop:**

Yeah, it was that kind of situation back then. And so, after the third company got bought by AOL, I decided, "Hey, this starting a company thing looks pretty easy. I should go do that." Not at all what I thought, actually. But we did start a company with some friends, and that's how we ended up doing silly things like doing demos that Bill Gates never saw, to be clear.

**Beyang Liu:**

Never saw.

**James Waldrop:**

Would have seen.

It's a story. I can tell you the story, but it's a story of hubris on my part, I would say. Taking on something that seems easy but it turns out to be mathematically quite difficult.

**Beyang Liu:**

I mean, I feel like that is a story that ought to be familiar to many of our listeners, every single engineer.

**James Waldrop:**

We've all been there, right?

**Beyang Liu:**

Yeah, yeah. So, what did that company do and what was this demo?

**James Waldrop:**

Yeah, so Construct Internet Design. I was the CTO, you know, the most technical person there.

The demo, that was not early on in our oeuvre, but at some point in there, we were doing work for Microsoft. We were also doing work for Netscape and SGI and Sony. We had a really good client list. What we did was we built demos effectively. They weren't all demos. Some of them were actually productized. We built the out-of-box experience for the Indy from SGI. When you started up your Indy for the first time, the out-of-box experience, the configuration, was a 3D world.

**Beyang Liu:**

What was the Indy from SGI?

**James Waldrop:**

SGI? Silicon Graphics.

**Beyang Liu:**

Silicon Graphics, yeah.

**James Waldrop:**

So, the Indy was kind of like a personal workstation that had really good 3D computing. A graphics workstation for individuals as opposed to one of those big mainframe systems like an Onix.

**Beyang Liu:**

I see. It sounds very ahead of its time.

**James Waldrop:**

Yeah. Well, we all know what happened with SGI, probably. If not, we can Google it.

Everything they did was ahead of its time. That's pretty much the definition of SGI right there. So, yeah, you configured your DNS settings in a 3D world. If that sounds really silly, well then you know the kind of work we did.

**Beyang Liu:**

Wow. I've seen stuff where people manage Docker containers in Minecraft, but ...

**James Waldrop:**

Yes, it's a lot like that. Just about that silly too.

**Beyang Liu:**

That as an enterprise product?

**James Waldrop:**

Yeah. Literally you would unbox it, and you needed a great experience. Of course, it needed to be 3D because it was SGI, so they hired us to build it for them.

**Beyang Liu:**

Wow.

**James Waldrop:**

Microsoft, at the time, had a technology that never made it out to the world. Hopefully no lawyers will come after me, but it was called Chrome, which is funny now since I'm in a Chrome browser looking at you. But Chrome was a 3D browser on the desktop. It was like, let's turn all of the normal 2D widgets into 3D. They needed a really cool demo.

I don't know how many 3D graphics nerds are going to be on your podcast, but it was a technology that originally was at Sun called TBAG, and the team ended up in Microsoft Research. It was all about what I would call functional 3D graphics. Functional, meaning, in the way that programming languages can be functional. And so, it was a really interesting idea. I still think it was a great idea. It was like a technology in search of a problem, right?

**Beyang Liu:**

Yeah.

**James Waldrop:**

We've all been there. And so, the way they were going to productize this was bringing 3D to the desktop. Cool, sounds great. It was right up our alley because we did a lot of 3D graphics stuff. They just needed a cool demo, and so they hired us to build a really cool demo.

They wanted us to work with this 3D artist that was relatively well known in the 3D community. I'm honestly blanking on his name, which is sad. Anyway, we were working with this relatively famous guy. He was going to design an animation and we would figure out how to get it into this Chrome technology.

At the time, I thought, "Okay, this is like file formats." Right? This is not that hard. And so, I quoted, I think, two weeks to do the work, to just be able to take an animation in one 3ds Max, if any of your folks know what that is, and take an animation out of 3ds Max and import it into Chrome.

Now, Chrome, of course, couldn't be really exciting unless you use the latest, greatest technology of the day, so you programed Chrome with JavaScript. This was–I forget when. 1999 maybe? 1998? Something like that.

**Beyang Liu:**

That was really ahead of its time.

**James Waldrop:**

Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Put all the pain to one place and then let's see.

**Beyang Liu:**

And not like modern JavaScript either. This was like late nineties-

**James Waldrop:**

This was back when it was originally called LiveScript. I mean, I think they were just out of the LiveScript era and into calling it JavaScript and Microsoft thought it was going to be a big deal. Hey, good for them. And they got half of it, right?

**Beyang Liu:**

Yeah.

**James Waldrop:**

So, the problem was that the APIs–this was such a nightmare for me–the APIs on the Chrome side only accepted ... Basically, it wouldn't accept a matrix for a transform. You could rotate, you could translate, you could skew, you could do all of those but you had to do them one by one. You couldn't do them all in one shot with a transformation matrix.

**Beyang Liu:**

Right.

**James Waldrop:**

3ds Max only exported matrices, okay? I'm like, okay, well I don't know what I'm doing here.

**Beyang Liu:**

Did you take any linear algebra courses in your theater program?

**James Waldrop:**

In my theater program?

**Beyang Liu:**

Yeah.

**James Waldrop:**

No, I took none. I took absolutely none of those classes, which I learned very quickly I needed to have done that.

So, I was looking at a 3D transformation matrix, which is a 4x4 because it's Q, if it's not clear why you would need a 4x4 for that. I was trying to decompose that into a series of transformations, translation, et cetera, scale, all that, and I was having a hard time of it. I eventually was like, man, I cannot figure out how these line up. I've started doing some actual research to figure out, well, how would someone who knows what they're doing attack this problem? I started seeing square roots. I was like, "Whoa, this is hairy." I started learning about eigenvectors and-

**Beyang Liu:**

This was like, what? One week into the project? Because you had two weeks.

**James Waldrop:**

Literally a week.

I mean, I needed to learn how to read the 3ds file format and I needed to learn enough Chrome to figure out what I needed to generate. Everything was going great until I had to actually animate anything because the animations were all these matrices. And I had some amazing bugs where the entire model would explode into a shower of fragments, which was obviously wrong.

I eventually got somebody who knew what the hell they were doing who told me, "Well, technically, this is actually mathematically impossible." There is no guaranteed mapping from this kind of matrix to what you're trying to do. I was like, "Oh, shit." I have learned since then. Actually, it was funny because the other day, I don't know why I did this–it's like I want to revisit past failures or something–but I went and looked at Stack Overflow. You know, Math Exchange?

**Beyang Liu:**

Yeah, yeah.

**James Waldrop:**

I found the perfect Stack Overflow question that answers my question as well as it can possibly be answered. But it's about 25 years too late, or 20 years too late. But yeah, that was why I never did a demo for Bill Gates.

**Beyang Liu:**

Interesting.

**James Waldrop:**

What they asked me to do instead was write up a paper on how hard it was, and why it was so hard, and what they should do about it. I'm pretty sure my paper said something like, "Listen, unless you can take input from the major modeling programs," the things people use to generate this content, "then it's not going to be successful." Because sitting there hand coding animations is fine for really simple demos but it's not going to work for character animation, for instance.

**Beyang Liu:**

Yeah. Interesting. Maybe this was perhaps the kernel of your interest in developer experience given that–

**James Waldrop:**

No.

**Beyang Liu:**

No?

**James Waldrop:**

I don't think so. No. I think the kernel of my interest in the developer experience was probably Salesforce.

**Beyang Liu:**

That's a good segue. So, from that company, you went through the dot com kind of boom and bust.

**James Waldrop:**

Yeah, we sold the company in '99. Really good timing.

**Beyang Liu:**

Oh, great timing.

**James Waldrop:**

Yeah. We actually made money. We avoided the bust. The bust then happened. I bounced to another company, I think a year and change after we've been acquired. Then the bust started in earnest and I started having to lay people off. If you've ever had to lay anybody off, I apologize and I sympathize with you. It was a very difficult experience and I really didn't like it at all.

And so, after the second round and the third round coming, I realized that I could fire myself and it would cover the budget delta that we had. I said, "You know what, it feels like it's that moment where I should just ride off into the sunset, solve our budget problem, and not ever have to lay anybody off again." God willing, I hope not to have to do that ever again because that was really emotionally distraught. I mean, of course, I had to do it. Which meant, I had a job. It was hard for me to fully appreciate what happens on the other side. I'll tell you, it's no fun for either party in that situation.

**Beyang Liu:**

Yeah.

**James Waldrop:**

But, yeah, after that I did whatever fit the bill for interesting work for a year and a half or so, and then another startup after that. Finally, after, I think, five or six rounds of the startup merry-go-round, I decided I should go work for a company that had a business model and was at least mildly successful at it. I picked one. It was probably a failed pick, but it did get me to Salesforce which clearly was a pretty successful company, and-

**Beyang Liu:**

So, you get in there through acquisition then or?

**James Waldrop:**

No. No, I was doing performance engineering for a company before that called OpSource.

**Beyang Liu:**

I see.

**James Waldrop:**

They got acquired eventually for way less than my stock was worth when I was there, so I wouldn't call that necessarily a successful exit for them. But the great thing about OpSource is that it taught me a love for performance engineering and helping other developers with their problems, whether those are performance problems or just general productivity.

I wanted to go to Salesforce because I wanted to go to some place where I could specialize, right? A lot of people want to avoid specialization. I think that's fine and good, but sometimes if you're getting really deep into something, you feel like if you could only do that thing full time, you could get really good at it. Salesforce gave me the opportunity to do that.

**Beyang Liu:**

Got it. So, what was your specialization at Salesforce?

**James Waldrop:**

Performance engineering. I was responsible for the core part of this system performance. Every time we did a release, we needed to make sure before it went out the door that we weren't going to break a million people's Salesforce instances because Salesforce is a pretty complex environment. If you've never touched it, it has its own programming language, WYSIWYG, GUI creation tool, and things like that, so you can really get into trouble fast.

I still vividly remember a situation where somebody added one extra call to a call stack. Because this thing was called millions of times per page render, it ended up being a massive regression.

**Beyang Liu:**

Wow.

**James Waldrop:**

You couldn't really rollback at Salesforce. But we had to delay the deploy and fix the problem and then deploy further.

**Beyang Liu:**

This is all part of their third party plugin ecosystem? Like the-

**James Waldrop:**

Yeah, you could call it that.

**Beyang Liu:**

Okay.

**James Waldrop:**

Sure. We don't have to go into all the details of how Salesforce’s developer APIs work, but yeah.

**Beyang Liu:**

Got it. And so, when did you get into more of the developer experience side of things? Was that a natural extension of your performance engineering work or is that a shift?

**James Waldrop:**

It was, but in a roundabout way. You're probably getting this theme here of roundabout journeys I've taken.

**Beyang Liu:**

Yeah.

**James Waldrop:**

I never go straight anywhere, it seems like. I was working on performance engineering, and Salesforce had a pretty sizable performance engineering team, and we wanted to grow further. I saw the chance to build a tool that could give regular engineers who aren't performance engineers the chance to figure out whether or not their code was going to scale before they actually even committed it to the repo.

I thought that would be fairly transformational for what I was doing because it would mean that I would only work on the really tough stuff and regular engineers just wouldn't commit performance problems in the first place. It would be great.

**Beyang Liu:**

Right.

**James Waldrop:**

Obviously they still do, but at least I would have something to beat them up with at the end of that. So, I really wanted to build that tool but I couldn't convince my ... I don't know if these people are still employed by Salesforce or whatever. I know everybody has their priorities but I could not convince my management team that this should be a priority.

It wasn't exactly because of that, but that sort of disenchanted me because I felt like I could avoid a lot of work. I'm a fairly lazy guy, as all engineers are, I hope, and I wanted to avoid that work. I wanted to just do the fun stuff, right?

And then at the same time, roughly, a friend of mine went to Twitter. He had been at Salesforce for a long time. He was one of the lead people that I worked with at Salesforce. When he got to Twitter, and I'm not going to say his name because–I don't know, the statute of limitations has probably long passed on this one, but still. When he got to Twitter, he said, "Hey, you need to get over here. We need your help with performance on Twitter."

I don't want to get the dates wrong. People can go look at my LinkedIn. They can find it.

**Beyang Liu:**

Was this still during the era of Rails?

**James Waldrop:**

Yeah. Twitter, at the time, was on Rails, yes.

**Beyang Liu:**

Okay.

**James Waldrop:**

And they were going through the re-architecture, we were going through the re-architecture to a JVM-based system.

**Beyang Liu:**

I see.

**James Waldrop:**

Not because it was Rails. All the Ruby people will come after me if I say that. It really wasn't Rails' fault, it wasn't Ruby's fault. And Twitter was only lightly Rails. I mean, I think most of Twitter wasn't Rails at all, to be clear. But certainly Ruby.

It was because of the architecture, how it's architected, and maybe more importantly how quickly it grew. The architecture that was going to be the one that would last us for two years might last for two months with the kind of growth rate that they were experiencing. And so, it was constantly falling over.

If you were a performance engineer, Twitter was this interesting mental problem. It was like a thought experiment: wow, what must they have done that they can't handle that much traffic? How would I design that architecture? What tricks could I play? You realize pretty quickly that despite all of the folks on Hacker News comments who love to say, "That's an easy problem, and I could build that in two weeks," that dealing with scale is hard. Yeah, they can build a pretty piss-poor version of Twitter that couldn't scale at all in two weeks. And so, it was an interesting place to think about going.

I said, "Yeah, hook me up. Let me know who I should talk to." So, I talked to this guy. I still vividly remember, I'm in my home office pacing back and forth, because, of course, I do my best thinking while I'm moving. He's asking me about my experience and telling me about Twitter and picking my brain as much as he could, and he called that an interview. It was a Sunday afternoon. His name is Raffi Krikorian. He went on to Uber where he led the ATG team in Pittsburgh that was doing all the self-driving car stuff, and then he became the CTO for the Democratic Party.

**Beyang Liu:**

Wow.

**James Waldrop:**

So, Raffi is one of these heavy hitters that I really appreciate having, because he's a smart guy. He impressed me and, I guess, I impressed him enough, and so I ended up at Twitter. Well, I didn't do performance engineering for four and a half years, and this is where it goes into developer tooling. We finally get to answer your question.

So, I built that tool and it let regular people, regular engineers, performance test their stuff at any level of scale. Millions of requests per second.

**Beyang Liu:**

How did that work? Did it spin up an instance of the app full of resources?

**James Waldrop:**

So, Twitter was very much drinking the microservice Kool-Aid. I don't mean that in a derogatory way. I think we absolutely should be at that scale.

**Beyang Liu:**

I mean, they were ahead of the curve, I think.

**James Waldrop:**

Probably so. Yeah, probably a little too painfully ahead of the curve. There was definitely a lot of bleeding in our bleeding edge approach to things.

**Beyang Liu:**

I see.

**James Waldrop:**

But still, it was the right choice in my opinion. When you have a service and you're bringing it up, you really only think of it like a function, right? It takes some inputs and it gives some outputs.

And so, what they needed to be able to determine was: if under a representative set of inputs–the load had to be right and the shape of the load, the kinds of requests had to be right–if it then could handle the request and give back responses that were correct. Which is a piece a lot of people miss in performance engineering. It's like, yeah, I can serve 404s or 503s really, really fast but can I serve correct content really quickly? So, you got to validate on the response side as well.

But at any rate, the way that it worked was it could either take a stream of production requests and replay them, which would be pretty representative of production. Or, for services that hadn't been in production yet, so they had no production traffic, it gave you a set of APIs that made it really easy to generate representative traffic. And then made it trivial. We knocked over Twitter, at least once with it, to scale up the traffic to the point of well beyond what Twitter would experience even in maybe another year. You could anticipate where you would fall over, which was probably the biggest problem that the company had before that. Well, maybe not the biggest problem. I'm exaggerating for my own benefit here.

But certainly a problem is that they knew they could scale with normal traffic. But when the spikes hit, that was when the system really was tested. And so, you needed to be able to simulate the spikes in order to know whether or not your new solution to the last scaling challenge, the last crash, would actually work. Because there were plenty of ideas about what could work, but you can't demand a plane land in the Hudson when you need it to, to test your system.

**Beyang Liu:**

Interesting. And all the spikes would happen around big events?

**James Waldrop:**

Plane landing in the Hudson and people are tweeting from the ferry, right? Michael Jackson has died.

**Beyang Liu:**

Got it. Got it.

**James Waldrop:**

It's New Year in Japan when everybody synchronizes their Happy New Year tweets to the second.

**Beyang Liu:**

Fascinating. So, I guess, what was the timespan of that project? At the time that I met you, you were working on ... I don't think you were working on that anymore.

**James Waldrop:**

No.

**Beyang Liu:**

So, what was the evolution of your work?

**James Waldrop:**

Well, I'm always trying to put myself out of a job. The faster I can put myself out of a job, the better. I've learned that in my career. That is a guaranteed way to success. It sounds bad, but it's actually very, very good.

And so, most of the tool was built in the first six months at Twitter. I think I was probably fully done, as much as I ever got done with anything since software can keep evolving, within a year. And so, after eight or nine months, I was on the developer productivity team. Within I think a year or so, I was managing the team.

**Beyang Liu:**

Got it.

**James Waldrop:**

That's when you met me. So, I feel very strongly that developers need tools that get out of the way, that just do what they need, give them really powerful ways to get the job done and get out of the way, otherwise. So many of the tools that we get handed are somebody's idea of what a good productive use case would look like. Really, they just need to hand us tools that work at the layer of abstraction we're used to working at. So, for performance engineering, for this tool, for instance, the right layer of abstraction was code.

People still use this tool called JMeter. It's very hard to code to JMeter. Writing JMeter plugins is kind of a nightmare. At least it used to be. I haven't tried lately. So, you're sitting there with some XML-generating interface, WYSIWYG performance tool, and you're like, "I don't know what to do here." But if you hand a set of APIs to a developer and tell them what those APIs do, then they're off to the races. They know exactly what to do with that because that's what they do in their job.

And so, you need to hand people tools that really meet them where they are instead of tying too tightly. I think people get trapped by: you have a problem and you end up with the first-order solution to that problem and it's too tightly fit to the problem instead of being fit to the solution.

**Beyang Liu:**

Yeah. There is this difference between dev tools and other software applications that are meant for non-developers. I feel that in the latter case, you're always trying to produce some kind of on-rails experience that doesn't allow for too much diversion from the core workflow because the idea is that you've thought of how to do this and the app guides you through that process. Whereas with developers, it's all about, like, oh, I don't want to do the same thing over and over again. I want something that allows me to go in random directions of my choosing.

**James Waldrop:**

Totally. I want the full power that the computer gives me, please.

**Beyang Liu:**

So, at Twitter, as manager of the developer productivity team, were you building additional tools internally for Twitter?

**James Waldrop:**

Yeah. We became responsible pretty quickly, except for mobile, for the lifecycle. We thought of it as building, testing, and deploying.

**Beyang Liu:**

Build, test, deploy.

**James Waldrop:**

Yeah, exactly. You think of that as like, okay, fine, you might want to throw a “monitor” in there, that's probably useful. We didn't operate that piece of the stack. But once you've deployed something, you find out what you need to do next, right?

**Beyang Liu:**

Yeah.

**James Waldrop:**

That's sort of a virtuous cycle. Like our version of the orient, observe, decide and act loop, the OODA loop. That's the developer thing. You want to make that as easy as possible. And so that's what we had as our mission: to help developers be productive by giving them as tight of a loop, as productive of a loop, as possible.

**Beyang Liu:**

Got it. Can you talk about what specific tools or processes were involved in that loop in those days at Twitter? This was, I think, circa, what, 2013 or 2014, maybe?

**James Waldrop:**

When did I go to Fitbit? Man, I'm feeling old.

**Beyang Liu:**

2015.

**James Waldrop:**

This was 2012, 2013. That timeframe. And then 2014, yes, and 2015, less. For me, anyway. The team was still doing that.

So, we did not try to own the IDE. It was catnip. It was very interesting for me to think about owning the IDE because that's clearly a place where a lot of productivity is gained or lost, but it's just too personal. Developers make those choices really early in their careers and it's hard to get them to change.

**Beyang Liu:**

Emacs and Vim.

**James Waldrop:**

Emacs and Vim, man, we had an arm wrestling contest at Twitter about that, and I hate to say it, but Vim lost. They're very disappointed.

**Beyang Liu:**

I mean, that's kind of obvious from where I'm coming from as an Emacs user.

**James Waldrop:**

No, I was crushed. I was crushed.

**Beyang Liu:**

Wait, did Twitter standardize on Emacs or?

**James Waldrop:**

No.

**Beyang Liu:**

Oh, okay. That would even surprise me.

**James Waldrop:**

Yeah. To be clear, it was Emacs versus Vi. There was no Vim. I mean, there was a Vim.

**Beyang Liu:**

Was this just like which editor gets installed in all the production?

**James Waldrop:**

No. This was just bragging rights.

**Beyang Liu:**

Oh.

**James Waldrop:**

Yeah, this was literally just like, hey, Emacs versus Vi, who's stronger?

**Beyang Liu:**

And all the Vi people finally saw the light and came over to Emacs?

**James Waldrop:**

You can imagine that that happened, but no.

**Beyang Liu:**

We just got done recording this Dev Tool Time, this other stream that we're doing with [Mitchell Hashimoto](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/dev-tool-time-mitchell-hashimoto/?_ga=2.93485403.753704949.1643295641-1161303122.1641224283). This is really great for me to hear because he told the story of how he switched from Emacs to Vim because-

**James Waldrop:**

Oh, no. He left the flock.

**Beyang Liu:**

Anyways.

**James Waldrop:**

Anywho. All right, here you go. Here it's just come up and it's right here. Yeah, he should know that at Twitter, which obviously has the strongest Vi people on the planet and the strongest Emacs people on the planet, it was decided that Emacs is stronger.

**Beyang Liu:**

There you have it.

**James Waldrop:**

Yes, there you have it. It's been decided. We didn't go that far because there was no way I was wading into that debate with people. I mean, we didn't even talk about IntelliJ.

So, we started at code review, okay? That's the point at which other people start interacting with your code, if you think about it that way. At least I thought about it that way. And so, we own the code review stack, we own the build system. You could think of the build system as being the earliest point. That would be a reasonable argument to make actually, now that I think about it. Build system, code review, the test infrastructure and test frameworks that people used, then the deploy tooling, how you actually got your code to production.

**Beyang Liu:**

Got it. And I think it was Review Board for code review and Pants for the build system?

**James Waldrop:**

I'm not at liberty to say so.

**Beyang Liu:**

Oh, sorry. Got it.

**James Waldrop:**

No, no, no, it's fine. Keep it in. We can talk about Pants. Twitter open sourced it. I was managing the team when we did that.

So, Twitter, as many Bay Area startups do, had a fair number of refugees from Google. Maybe more than most, I would say. And so, they had all used Blaze at Google. There was no Bazel at that point in time, and so they all missed their old build tool. So, Twitter, and it turns out Facebook did this too, wrote clones of Blaze and then Google went and open sourced Bazel. And so now we have three different Blaze-inspired open source build tools that people could use if they want to.

But Twitter, of course, had theirs, Pants. Has theirs, still, I believe. I don't know, I haven't checked in to see if they've moved to anything else since I left. We were on Maven when I started. Maven was causing us a lot of trouble, a lot of trouble. It couldn't really walk the dependency graph in any reasonable way, and you really need that once you're in a monorepo. That's almost job one for your build tool on a monorepo. We had these crazy ass Maven POM XMLs that were deeply nested.

I remember buying a Mac Pro, like the trash can black Mac Pro, because I needed something that could literally compile the whole repo for reasons and I needed enough memory. And so the right choice was, of course, to spend, I don't know how much, on a really expensive computer from Apple. I don't even think I expensed it.

**Beyang Liu:**

Wow.

**James Waldrop:**

Yeah. Well, I still have it so I get my money's worth. At any rate, yeah, it was a hard problem. And so, Pants was our solution to that problem.

**Beyang Liu:**

Interesting. I guess taking a step back, I bet a good number of listeners are working on developer productivity, or are maybe part of a developer productivity team, or maybe even running it. What are your thoughts on how to run an effective dev prod organization? What are the things to look out for? What are the things that you measure? How do you define success?

**James Waldrop:**

It's good that you mentioned measurement. Measurement is a two-edged sword.

If you're on a team that has the goal to name itself “developer productivity,” you've got to be able to show that you're making people more productive, right?

**Beyang Liu:**

Yeah.

**James Waldrop:**

If you're not doing that, then you're not going to get headcount, that's for sure. Headcount is lifeblood for these teams. So, you need some metrics, but you really need to avoid being overly managed by your metrics. It can be very easy for those metrics to become targets that you have to hit as opposed to simply: are we improving life for developers?

So, we measured things like build times, obviously. We knew all the slowest build targets. We could identify whether or not your machine needed to be upgraded because build targets were running slow for you, that were running fast for other people. We could say, "Huh, there's something going on with your system. Let's figure out what it is." It's a corporate environment, so we could log all of the builds and ship them all up to our servers and see our metrics change as we release things. People loved that.

We put a fair amount of effort into metrics around code review and trying to optimize for efficiency in code review. Because people can put not much time into a great code review or they can put a lot of time into a bad code review and, obviously, all the combinations therein.

And then metrics around testing and getting stuff out to production, yeah sure. But I would say, the pieces that we most wanted to optimize, at least when I was there, were the build times and the code reviews. Code reviews, at the time when we were first tackling this problem, would take three, four, five days to get back to a PR.

**Beyang Liu:**

Wow.

**James Waldrop:**

Yeah, that was really hampering the productivity of teams left and right, as you can imagine.

**Beyang Liu:**

Long cycle times are killer.

**James Waldrop:**

Especially when it's code review because they come back a few days later, and now you have to get back into the flow of what you were thinking and figure out why they're wrong or maybe why they're right. Yeah, it's just a lot of effort.

**Beyang Liu:**

How do you drive down review time without compromising quality? Because that's one of the metrics that can be easy to game. I remember chatting with one engineering leader who ... I think he was at the point where he wrote a script to understand the review graph, to see who is reviewing. Because he suspected, and this was confirmed, that there were these cliques in the graph where people would just review each other's code, give a quick, "looks good to me" just to get a review.

**James Waldrop:**

Yeah, right. Looks good to me. Exactly. Just a rubber stamp. Yeah, it was a code review ring.

**Beyang Liu:**

Yeah, exactly. That's like a real thing.

**James Waldrop:**

Yeah, that makes sense. So, I looked at the data a lot. Variations in the data were really interesting to me. We mostly didn't interact with the mobile team too much. We're mostly backend focused. Most of Twitter's engineers were backend engineers. But I remember looking at Gerrit data. The Android team used Gerrit at the time, and may still.

Gerrit, if you're not familiar with it, has this concept of a +1 reviewer and a +2 reviewer. A +1 reviewer can say they don't have any comments, it looks good. A +2 reviewer is like "Ship it!" They're authoritative.

We didn't have enough +2 reviewers. I could show that as we added +2 reviewers to different parts of the code base, the code review times went down, which is obvious, I hope. But we needed the data to show that it was worth getting more people into that +2 role and that it was really a priority, that we shouldn't hold that bit in reserve and only give it to the precious few people who had earned it–air quotes around “earned.”

We needed to spread the love a bit and it would help everybody if we did. And yes, of course, the bar, if there is a bar for this kind of thing, might be lowered in the process–oh, my god–but it would be better overall. So, we showed that the right things would happen if we added more resources to the system, as it were.

Other kinds of things like the SREs were very fast to review things, and I was suspicious of that, similar to your friend being suspicious about whether they were actually looking at it.

I'm very data driven. I try to be very data driven–as much as I can. So, I would go look at these and get a good representative sample of what's happening in these reviews. What I realized is that these were config files. They were not rubber stamping. They were looking at the changes, but they're just easier to review. There's not as much to understand. And so, it made sense that they were lower and we shouldn't consider them as representative of the target for the rest of the population of developers. If they had three-hour code reviews, that didn't didn't mean that everybody should have three-hour code reviews.

I had a funny moment where I was talking to the CEO of Twitter in the hallway. I think the conversation lasted all of 45 seconds, which was pretty much how much every conversation with Dick Costolo lasted, honestly. I think I had a 50-minute one-on-one with him once and I was out the door in under five minutes because he was very efficient with his time. It was kind of inspirational, I got to say.

Anyway, I ran into him in the hallway and I was telling him about some success we'd had where we were able to drop code reviews by a day, let's say. Maybe from three days to two, something like that. I forget the exact details. He was like, "Great! That's great! Now, when are we going to get it down to zero?" And I said, "Oh, so ..." I mean, he is the CEO of Twitter, but I have never been afraid of potentially hurting myself if I'm telling the truth. I'm always willing to tell the truth. I said, "That's not exactly where we want to go with this. We're reviewing the code to make sure that it's high quality. We could just not do it." I don't know if I said that part. But he was very funny. He said, "Oh, yeah, that was a bad idea. Forget I ever said it. Good work." And then he kept walking down the hallway.

**Beyang Liu:**

That was awesome. I feel like I've mismanaged the time in this conversation.

**James Waldrop:**

Oh, are we way over time?

**Beyang Liu:**

No, no, no. We're coming up on the end. We still have a little bit of time left, but I wanted to just briefly touch upon your experience at Fitbit and what that was like.

**James Waldrop:**

Yeah. Not in the developer productivity role, honestly. Fitbit has a team like that. When Fitbit hired me, they had performance engineering problems to start with, and they hired me to solve those. True to form, I solved those. Well, I can't say I solved those. Honestly, I was a program manager for that project more than anything else. But they needed somebody to identify that they were on the right track with stuff, and then they needed somebody to help keep the trains running on time. So, that was the most impactful thing I could do for that project, make sure that they survived Christmas.

So, New Years is a big day, a big moment for Twitter because everybody's tweeting Happy New Year in Japan all at the right moment. For Fitbit, Christmas is a big day because everybody's opening up their presents and they're turning on their Fitbits and signing up for the first time.

The year before I started, the site had been down on Christmas for basically the entire day. Seven hours, I think, the site was down for. I started just before they went public, but the thesis I had going in was, "Listen, I've heard that we're going public.” Everybody nods their heads. "I'm pretty sure that if we're down for seven hours, our first Christmas as a public company, that won't be good for the stock." I got a lot of more head nods to that. And so I said, "Great, so everybody agrees this is our number one priority, right?" Yes, everybody agrees. "Okay, good. As long as we're clear on priorities, then we can move forward."

That's where I started, but I was honestly done with that project around Christmas. I spent a very interesting Christmas watching graphs instead of opening presents. I mean, I don't need to knock on wood. I'm compelled to knock on wood right now, but it's in the past. We survived Christmas, so that was good. Yeah, I moved on to other things at Fitbit.

Yeah, for Fitbit, as an IC, I was mostly a high profile, high performance troubleshooter. I would come in and fix things. I was involved in some acquisitions and I was involved in some product launches. I would get involved in whatever needed my special brand of problem solving.

**Beyang Liu:**

I just want to get your take on two things. One is this role-hopping that you've done throughout your career. You referenced this earlier with the winding circuitous path that you've taken through your professional life. You've gone back and forth from IC to management and then back again multiple times. I wanted to get your take on that because I think oftentimes people think of IC and management as two distinct tracks. You can hop from one to the other, but there are two distinct tracks there. But it seems like you've just fluidly hopped between one and the other, and that's worked out very well for you and also well for the companies that you've been at. So, what are your thoughts on that?

**James Waldrop:**

I'll give you my thoughts, but I also want to make sure people don't ignore obvious other thoughts that are relatively well known. I think her name is Charity Majors, the Honeycomb founder?

**Beyang Liu:**

Yeah. Yes.

**James Waldrop:**

I remember reading a blog post of hers and thinking that it was crazy insightful. She talks about the pendulum from management to IC and it's swinging both ways, and it being good for your career. So, she put all of her thoughts in writing. No offense to all of your listeners, but as somebody who prefers to learn by reading instead of by listening, I think that that would be worth reading.

It's been a few years now since she wrote that. I imagine it's probably not on the meme cycle on Twitter or anything, so it could be that people will have missed it but I really recommend reading that. Hopefully you can Google it and find it from there.

So, yeah, I have never really shied away from a job that I didn't understand clearly. Right?

**Beyang Liu:**

That's your MO.

**James Waldrop:**

I'm willing to wade really deeply into stuff I don't know about. I try not to be totally Dunning-Kruger about it. I don't go in thinking I know what I'm doing, necessarily, but I certainly can get into deeper waters than I expected. Because of that, it's never the case that I'm sitting there going, oh, will this be good for my career, or how is this going to work out? It's not really a thought process for me, to be honest–mostly because it always has worked out. I think I have a pretty good eye for opportunity and being able to recognize what the main chance in a situation is. So, there's that.

As far as moving between the roles go, it's natural as you become more senior as an IC. There's a point at which you either are John Carmack or you're not. Your coding chops have gotten as strong as they're likely to get. Unless you want to go get a PhD and become a domain expert in something, and then it's not. You're not being measured by the code you write, you're being measured by the ideas.

**Beyang Liu:**

Right.

**James Waldrop:**

But as an IC, you're not going to get super strong. You're not going to become a God-level coder principal engineer or whatever the top of your local ladder is. So, really what happens is that over time you learn how to work with people, sad to say. I mean, some people will be sad to hear that, but yes, we have to learn to work with people. And you learn how to influence them. Right?

The game of influence is really interesting. I really enjoy it because there's lots of ways to go about it. I like to talk about playing chess instead of poker. It turns out, I like playing chess instead of poker because I'm really bad at poker. I don't have any kind of poker face. And so, knowing that I don't have a poker face, I choose to play a different game.

And so, I make everybody clear about what my motivations are. As long as I'm authentic about it, I feel like you can always find a way to align priorities. Of course, in the business, “Why?” was the very first question I asked at Fitbit because if it wasn't the priority, then I should go work on something else.

**Beyang Liu:**

Right.

**James Waldrop:**

But as long as you're working on the right set of priorities, then it's easy to get ... “Easy,” air quotes. It can be hard, but you will find a way to get people to support your effort, or whatever that is, and you don't need to be a manager.

Of course, I needed to be a manager to see that side of things before I realized how the management game works, and then go back to being an IC and use the knowledge I had gained going to the evil empire. Then I'm like, okay, I know how the evil empire works now so I can influence them from their perspective, from where they sit. And I can use language that works for them as well as for ICs.

And so, understanding both perspectives I think is pretty important, at least it's been important for me. I think there's probably an 80% overlap, roughly, between what I would call the leadership circle of a Venn diagram. There is high-level IC and there's high-level management, whatever that looks like and then there's leadership. There's a good amount of overlap between those two roles on a team or in a company.

It's really interesting. The one last thing I'm going to say on this is that it was easy for me as kind of the prototypical, “stumbles into things and comes up smelling like a rose,” to imagine that that overlap was close to total and that as a senior IC, I could move into a senior management role without feeling any pain. That turned out to be not true.

At one point at Fitbit, I went from managing zero people but having a very senior role to managing 450 people in a very senior role, and it was overnight. It was literally overnight and not entirely expected either. And so, I thought that I would be fine at that. It turned out that I still had quite a lot to learn.

So, I don't want to overemphasize the ease in which people can swap between those roles. I do think that at these more senior levels, at scale, it's very different.

**Beyang Liu:**

One last question.

**James Waldrop:**

Sure.

**Beyang Liu:**

I wanted to get your take on work-life balance, which is a very hot topic. I want to frame the question by reading this tweet from-

**James Waldrop:**

Oh, no. Is this from me? I hope no.

**Beyang Liu:**

No. No, no. Not from you but from Bill Gates. Sticking with the Bill Gates thing.

**James Waldrop:**

Oh. There you go.

**Beyang Liu:**

So, Bill Gates tweets, this was two or three years ago. He said, "Back in my early Microsoft days, I routinely pulled all-nighters when we had to deliver a piece of software. I even stayed up two nights in a row on occasion. I don't recommend that. This book taught me a lot about the importance of a better night's sleep." He's showing a book.

And then Keith Rabois, who is a prominent venture capitalist on Twitter, errs on the side of being a little controversial quote tweets-

**James Waldrop:**

Moved to Miami.

**Beyang Liu:**

Yes. Quote tweets Bill Gates and says, "Exactly." The implication being if you're young and ambitious, do as Bill Gates did, not as he is saying to do now that he is accomplished and successful. Would you care to weigh in on the age-old debate of work-life balance?

**James Waldrop:**

Between Bill Gates and Keith Rabois. Yeah, that's great. I definitely should pick a winner on that one. You know, it's funny because Bill Gates was actually directly responsible for me losing a lot of sleep because of that demo.

I said it was going to take two weeks. I think it was three weeks in, then I said, "This is hard and I'm going to be late." I worked on it for at least another two weeks. I vividly remember, I don't think I went home at all for at least two weeks of that project.

**Beyang Liu:**

Wow.

**James Waldrop:**

I literally crawled under my desk and went to sleep, and then I got back up in the morning. God help anybody who worked ... I mean, I had my own space, thankfully, because we didn't have a shower so I don't know what the story was there.

**Beyang Liu:**

Oh, my god.

**James Waldrop:**

It was that prototypical. It was that story, right? I pulled two all-nighters. "Yeah, Bill, I don't know how many all nighters I'd pull for you." There were naps in there, but I hesitate to say that I got a full night's sleep for at least a couple of weeks, and it sucked. It absolutely sucked. It was probably one of the most demoralizing times of my life.

I think for the wrong kind of person, or the right kind of person, depending on how you look at it I guess, this is not a great experience. I will say–wrong. It can be kind of like the depression cycle of feeling like you're not good enough at what you're doing, you just need to work harder. Right? Which inevitably ... Maybe not inevitably.

**Beyang Liu:**

It can be self-fulfilling once you get into that.

**James Waldrop:**

Exactly. You put in more time, you lose sleep and you're not more productive with that time.

**Beyang Liu:**

Yeah.

**James Waldrop:**

Right? And so, you end up losing ground and you get more upset at yourself. That spiral is no fun at all. I mean, having been there at least once in my career, no good.

And so, if somebody is listening to this and that resonates for them, the thing to do is to actually–you have to be explicit about this–put some things down and stop doing some things. Explicitly call out your management or whoever is the authority in your situation and say, "I can't do all of this. I need to stop doing some of it. Please help me prioritize."

That's an aside, but I want to make sure I call that out. Because I think that the culture of work does lead to that for some people, and I think it leads to really bad outcomes. Really bad outcomes for them.

So, I guess, I'm going to be on the side of sleep. I work at Fitbit. We measure sleep and we know what a good night's sleep does. I've personally run experiments on myself. I'm the best example of the craziest scientists. If you're going to test on somebody, test on yourself.

The best test I ever ran was to have kids, just to bring this conversation full circle. All the way back to the beginning. Having kids and watching the effect that kids had on my sleep. At that point, we didn't have Sleep Score but now we do, so now you can have a single number to measure your night's sleep. Super reductionist and helpful for some mindsets, I think.

At any rate, we know what sleep does to performance. And yeah, you need a good night's sleep. I do not think that you are performing any better by having put an extra six hours in and only having three hours of sleep. I really actually strongly believe that. If I'm going to weigh in, I'm going to weigh in on the side of Bill here, even though he cost me a lot of sleep.

**Beyang Liu:**

Got it. Makes sense. What would you say to folks who say, well, yes, all that is true, don't get into the burnout cycle, don't get an unhealthily low amount of sleep, but what value is there in pushing the bounds of what you think you're capable of, especially when you're early in your career?

**James Waldrop:**

Young and full of energy?

**Beyang Liu:**

Yeah.

**James Waldrop:**

Yeah, that's probably true. It's a fine argument. The question I really would ask myself or ask them to ask themselves is: are you going to know when you're past that point, when you're no longer being productive with your time? Or are you just going to keep going because you've got the hustle culture that hard?

I think the right thing to do in that situation is to make promises to your future self. For your future self, you should say, “I'm going to get seven hours of sleep at night,” okay? Not eight hours, maybe that's too much. I think we can all say seven hours is not too much.

Six hours is probably too little. Yes, there are people out there who are short sleepers. Raffi seems to be one of those. I mentioned him earlier. But most of us are not short sleepers.

Run an experiment. Try getting the amount of sleep that is recommended for two weeks. It takes some time. But do it for two weeks in a row and have some cognitive tests you run on yourself.

I have a number of different ways that I run cognitive tests on myself to see just how I'm doing. I can watch my performance degrade when I haven't had good sleep, and I can watch my performance improve when I've had good sleep. I would run it as an experiment to see how it goes. I'm pretty much going to guarantee you that having a good night's sleep is going to show some benefit. And then once you figure out what, dial it in. I dialed it in like this. For me, my target right now is seven and a half hours.

**Beyang Liu:**

Yeah.

**James Waldrop:**

Right? The one thing to know, if you're not going to go buy a Fitbit, which is fine, but I will put my plug in, if you're not going to go buy a Fitbit, then you should know that the time you go to bed and the time you wake up, you need to subtract an hour from how much sleep you think you've gotten. Because you will have lost about that much sleep from what you think. If you do 8:00 AM minus whatever time you went to bed, take an hour off that because you're going to be off by about that much. So, don't think you're getting seven hours just because you went to bed at midnight and woke up at 7:00 AM.

**Beyang Liu:**

Makes sense. What's an example of a cognitive test that you do?

**James Waldrop:**

Oh, well, I'm going to make everybody laugh. You know this game FreeCell?

**Beyang Liu:**

The old Windows?

**James Waldrop:**

Like it's a Solitaire game.

**Beyang Liu:**

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**James Waldrop:**

So, FreeCell turns out to be really, really hard to get any unsolvable games. You can get harder games or easier games, but I can generally solve a FreeCell game in a particular amount of time.

**Beyang Liu:**

Interesting.

**James Waldrop:**

I play FreeCell just because I enjoy it. It's like, almost, a meditation for me. And I know how fast I should solve it. If I'm off, if I'm making poor choices, then it's very obvious in my time.

**Beyang Liu:**

Fascinating.

**James Waldrop:**

That's an example that works for me, but obviously other people could use Sudoku or could use a math problem, or maybe they've got some programming kata that they like to do.

**Beyang Liu:**

Cool. Well, thanks so much for taking the time. This was a fantastic conversation, I feel like I learned a lot. I feel like we didn't even get to half the things I wanted to talk about, so maybe we should do this again.

**James Waldrop:**

Yeah, take another bite of the apple. Yeah, give it a year. People might be interested again.

**Beyang Liu:**

Cool.

**James Waldrop:**

Sweet. I appreciated the invitation. If anybody has any questions for me … I always say this at the end of any conversation I have with a big group of people. I'm imagining a massive crowd of people listening to this podcast, all of whom, of course, hanging on our every word. If they have any questions for me, they're more than welcome to reach out. It's not hard to find my information. As far as how to get hold of me–Twitter. Don't use LinkedIn. Unfortunately, I do not look at that. But other mechanisms will work.

**Beyang Liu:**

Cool. All right, well thanks for being on the show today, James.

**James Waldrop:**

Yeah. See you later.
