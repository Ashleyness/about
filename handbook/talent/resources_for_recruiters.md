### Slack Kick-Off Process
- Create a new channel slack channel named: “team-hiring_position_recruiter-name”
   - Example: “ops-hiring_handbook-product-manager_recruiter-kelsey”
- Invite the entire interview panel plus Carly & Trevor to the channel
- Tag Carly to make the channel private
- Once private, send kick off note using the below template:

Hi team!  We are excited to kick off our [hyperlink job description] opening and I appreciate all of you participating in the interview process.  I thought it would be helpful to create a Slack channel to stay aligned as we begin interviewing candidates! 

- Interview process / hiring team:
   - Recruiter screen: _______
   - Hiring Manager screen:  _______
   - Assignment, if applicable: _______

When choosing two people to be on the values interview, please keep in mind the following:

Using [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NUDEjzud_GxocjKkd__m0hTf21tN3OIgOwtk_OjhV20/edit?ts=60e4c3bd#gid=0), [@hiring manager], please select two people who are highlighted in green (indicating that they have been here for 3 months or longer). In addition, here is a [doc](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/hiring/evaluating_values) that outlines the values interview. Once you've identified your interviewers, I will ensure they are trained & ready to go!

To review the interview process / what to expect as we begin interviewing candidates, please reference the guidelines for hiring managers doc [in the handbook](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/resources_for_hiring_managers)

### Values Team Kick-Off Process
Please ask the Hiring Manager if they have any suggestions for their role.
Reminders:

- Must have been here for 3+ months. Here is a [doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NUDEjzud_GxocjKkd__m0hTf21tN3OIgOwtk_OjhV20/edit?ts=60e4c3bd#gid=0) that lists everyone who has been here for 3+ months. 
- Must be two people from different departments
- Please keep diversity in mind when selecting teams

Once the values team has been selected, the Recruiter is responsible for sending a Slack to each values team saying:

"Hi team! As you know, our values interview is critical to ensuring that our new hires embody our values, and we need our teammates help! The two of you have been nominated to serve as the values team for the [role title]!  We recognize that this is outside of your day-to-day responsibilities, so please let us know if you're willing to participate (and if you're too busy right now, no worries! We can always add you to another team when your schedule allows). If you both agree to opt in, below are some helpful details:

- The two of you will conduct a 30-minute values interview for all [role title] finalists.  We anticipate 3-5 total interviews (so this would be a 1.5-2.5 hour commitment) and will be spread out over multiple days.
- One of you will need to opt in as the lead (this person is the one who begins the introduction and asks the first question).
- [Here](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/hiring/evaluating_values) is a resource to help you in the interview. 
- All structured interview questions are listed in your Greenhouse scorecard, found in the interview prep link in your interview calendar invite. 

Please let me know if this is something you're both willing to participate in and I'll add you to the interview plan.  And if you have any questions or would like to practice in advance of the interview, let me know and I'll send a calendar invite!"

### LinkedIn posting best practices
It is much better to copy and paste the entire post and then give the author credit by tagging them. Long story short, avoid resharing and copy/paste instead.

Avoid including links directly in your posts. Anything that takes the user away from LinkedIn is discouraged... so instead, add the link as a comment.
